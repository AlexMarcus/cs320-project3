The make and run procedure for this program is very straightforward.

A "make" command will create an instance of the program "project2" in the current directory.

To run with a single input file, a "./project1 [INPUT FILENAME] [INORDER EXECUTION] [OOO EXECUTION]" command can be issued. If the input is in a directory, the filename needs to be changed to [DIRECTORY PATH]/[FILENAME]. The same rules apply to the outputs.
